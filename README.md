# Java

##Important Points
. The process of Java programming can be simplified in three steps:
1. Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file - HelloWorld.java.
2. Compile it by typing "javac HelloWorld.java" in the terminal window.
3. Execute (or run) it by typing "java HelloWorld" in the terminal window. // NOTE here HelloWorld is the class name not the file name.
